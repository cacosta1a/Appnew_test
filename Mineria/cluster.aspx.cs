fruitarian diet he thought the name was fun spirited and not intimidating apple s first logo designed by ron wayne depicts sir isaac newton sitting under an apple tree it was almost immediately replaced by rob janoff s rainbow apple the now familiar rainbow colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it janoff presented jobs with several different monochromatic themes for the bitten logo and jobs immediately took a liking to it while jobs liked the logo he insisted it be in color to humanize the company the logo was designed with a bite so that it would not be confused with a cherry the colored stripes were conceived to make the logo more accessible and to represent the fact the apple ii could generate graphics in color both janoff and apple deny any homage to turing in the design of the logo on august 27 1999 but apple inc had trademark issues with apple corps apple corps ltd a multimedia company started by the beatles in 1967 involving their name and logo this resulted in a apple corps v apple computer series of lawsuits and tension between the two companies these issues ended with settling of their most recent lawsuit in 2007 advertising apple s first slogan byte into an apple was coined in the late 1970s from 1997 2002 the slogan think different was used in advertising campaigns and is still closely associated with apple apple also has slogans for specific product lines nbsp for example ithink therefore imac was used in 1998 to promote the imac and say hello to iphone has been used in iphone advertisements hello was also used to introduce the original macintosh newton platform newton imac hello again and ipod since the introduction of the macintosh in 1984 with the 1984 television commercial 1984 super bowl commercial to the more modern get a mac adverts apple has been recognized in the past for its efforts towards effective advertising and marketing for its products though its apple inc advertising criticism advertising was criticized for the claims made by some later campaigns particularly the 2005 power mac ads and iphone ads in britain apple s product commercials gained fame for launching musicians into stardom as a result of their eye popping graphics and catchy tunes first the company popularized canadian singer feist singer feist s 1234 song 1234 song in its ad campaign apple s brand loyalty is considered unusual for any product at one time apple evangelists were actively engaged by the company but this was after the phenomenon was already firmly established apple evangelist guy kawasaki has called the brand fanaticism something that was stumbled upon apple has however supported the continuing existence of a network of macintosh user group mac user groups in most major and many minor centers of population where mac computers are available mac users would meet at the european apple expo and the san francisco macworld conference expo trade shows where apple traditionally introduced new products each year to the industry and public until apple pulled out of both events while the conferences continue apple does not have official representation there mac developers in turn continue to gather at the annual apple worldwide developers conference apple store openings can draw crowds of thousands with some waiting in line as much as a day before the opening or flying in from other countries for the event the new york city fifth avenue cube store had a line as long as half a mile a few mac fans took the opportunity of the setting to propose marriage the ginza opening in tokyo was estimated in the thousands with a line exceeding eight city blocks john sculley told the guardian newspaper in 1997 people talk about technology but apple was a marketing company it was the marketing company of the decade research in 2002 by nielsen online netratings indicate that the average apple consumer was usually more affluent and better educated than other pc company consumers the research indicated that this correlation could stem from the fact that on average apple inc products are more expensive than other pc products corporate affairs during the mac s early history apple generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for hardware instead creating their own this trend was largely reversed in the late 1990s beginning with apple s adoption of the peripheral component interconnect pci bus in the power macintosh 7500 7500 power macintosh 8500 8500 power macintosh 9500 9500 power macintosh power macs apple has since adopted usb agp hypertransport wi fi and other industry standards in its computers and was in some cases a leader in the adoption of standards such as usb firewire is an apple originated standard that has seen widespread industry adoption after it was standardized as ieee 1394 ever since the first apple store opened apple has sold third party accessories for instance at one point nikon and canon company canon digital cameras were sold inside the store adobe software adobe one of apple s oldest software partners also sells its mac compatible software as does microsoft who sells microsoft office for the mac books from john wiley sons who publishes the for dummies series of instructional books are a notable exception however the publisher s line of books were banned from apple stores in 2005 because steve jobs disagreed with their decision to publish an unauthorized jobs biography icon after the launch of the ibookstore apple stopped selling physical books both online and at the apple retail stores headquarters apple inc s world corporate headquarters are located in the middle of silicon valley at 1 6 infinite loop street infinite loop cupertino california cupertino california this apple campus has six buildings that total and was built in 1993 by sobrato development cos in 2006 apple announced its intention to build a second campus on assembled from various contiguous plots east of n wolfe road between pruneridge avenue and vallco parkway later acquisitions increased this to 175 acres the new campus also in cupertino will be about east of the current campus the new campus building will be designed by norman foster on october 15 2013 it was announced that the cupertino city council has approved the proposed spaceship design campus on june 7 2011 steve jobs gave a presentation to cupertino city council detailing the architectural design of the new building and its environs the new campus is planned to house up to 13 000 employees in one central four storied circular building with a caf for 3 000 sitting people integrated surrounded by extensive landscape with parking mainly underground and the rest centralized in a parking structure the new campus will be built on the former hp headquarters next to interstate 280 the morning of the announcement apple ceo tim cook tweeted our home for innovation and creativity for decades to come cupertino city council gives unanimous approval for apple s new campus the 2 8 million square foot facility which will include steve jobs s original designs for a fitness center and corporate auditorium will be able to house 14 000 employees and will have enough parking to accommodate almost all of them apple s headquarters for europe the middle east and africa emea are located in cork city cork in the south of republic of ireland ireland the facility which opened in 1980 was apple s first location outside of the united states apple sales international which deals with all of apple s international sales outside of the usa is located at apple s campus in cork along with apple distribution international which similarly deals with apple s international distribution network on april 20 2012 apple announced the addition of 500 new jobs to its european headquarters this will bring the total workforce from around 2 800 to 3 300 employees the company will build a new office block on its hollyhill campus to accommodate the additional staff corporate culture apple was one of several highly successful companies founded in the 1970s that bucked the traditional notions of what a corporate culture should look like in organizational hierarchy flat versus tall casual versus formal attire etc other highly successful firms with similar cultural aspects from the same period include southwest airlines and microsoft originally the company stood in opposition to staid competitors like ibm by default thanks to the influence of its founders steve jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after apple was a fortune 500 company by the time of the 1984 television commercial 1984 tv ad this trait had become a key way the company attempted to differentiate itself from its competitors according to a 2011 report in fortune magazine fortune this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation as the company has grown and been led by a series of chief executives each with his own idea of what apple should be some of its original character has arguably been lost but apple still has a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably draws talented people into its employ this was especially after jobs s return to recognize the best of its employees apple created the apple fellows program awarding individuals who made extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to personal computing while at the company the apple fellowship has so far been awarded to a few individuals including bill atkinson steve capps rod holt guy kawasaki al alcorn don norman numerous employees of apple have cited that projects without jobs s involvement often took longer than projects with his involvement at apple employees are specialists who are not exposed to functions outside their area of expertise jobs saw this as a means of having best in class employees in every role for instance ron johnson businessman ron johnson who was senior vice president of retail operations until november 1 2011 was responsible for site selection in store service and store layout yet he had no control of the inventory in his stores which is done company wide by then coo and now ceo tim cook who has a background in supply chain management this is the opposite of general electric s corporate culture which has created well rounded managers the company previously advertised its products as being made in america up to the late 1990s however as a result of outsourcing initiatives in the 2000s almost all of its manufacturing is now done abroad according to a report by the new york times apple insiders believe the vast scale of overseas factories as well as the flexibility diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers have so outpaced their american counterparts that made in the u s a is no longer a viable option for most apple products unlike other major us companies apple has a relatively simple compensation policy for executives which does not include perks that other ceos enjoy such as country club fees and private use of company aircraft the company usually grants stock options to executives every other year a media article published in july 2013 provided details about apple s at home apple advisors customer support program that serves as the corporation s call center the advisors are employed within the u s and work remotely after undergoing a four week training program that also serves as a testing period the advisors earn between us 9 and 12 per hour and receive intensive management to ensure a high quality of customer support employee relations a class action lawsuit alleging that the company suppressed employee compensation has been filed against apple in a california federal district court litigation apple has been a participant in various legal proceedings and claims since it began operation and like its competitors and peers engages in litigation trying legal cases before the courts in its normal course of business for a variety of reasons in particular apple is known for and promotes itself as actively and aggressively enforcing its intellectual property interests some examples include apple v samsung apple v microsoft motorola mobility v apple inc motorola v apple apple corps v apple computer finance in its fiscal year ending in september 2011 apple inc reported a total of 108 billion in annual revenues a significant increase from its 2010 revenues of 65 billion and nearly 82 billion in cash reserves apple achieved these results while losing market share in certain product categories

on april 21 2011 greenpeace released a report highlighting the fact that data centers consumed up to 2 of all global electricity and this amount was projected to increase phil radford of greenpeace said we are concerned that this new explosion in electricity use could lock us into old polluting energy sources instead of the clean energy available today on april 17 2012 following a greenpeace protest of apple apple inc released a statement committing to ending its use of coal and shifting to 100 clean energy in 2013 apple announced it was using 100 renewable energy to power their data centers and overall 75 of its power comes from renewable sources in 2010 climate counts a nonprofit organization dedicated to directing consumers toward the greenest companies gave apple a score of 52 points out of a possible 100 which puts apple in their top category striding this was an increase from may 2008 when climate counts only gave apple 11 points out of 100 which placed the company last among electronics companies at which time climate counts also labeled apple with a stuck icon adding that apple at the time was a choice to avoid for the climate conscious consumer toxics greenpeace has campaigned against apple because of various environmental issues including a global end of life take back plan non recyclable hardware components and toxins within iphone hardware since 2003 greenpeace has campaigned against apple s use of particular chemicals in its products more specifically the inclusion of polyvinyl chloride pvc and brominated flame retardant bfrs in their devices on may 2 2007 steve jobs released a report announcing plans to eliminate pvc and bfrs by the end of 2008 apple has since eliminated pvc and bfrs from its product range becoming the first laptop

all apple products now being free of pvc vinyl plastic and brominated flame retardants however the guide criticizes apple on the energy criteria for not seeking external verification of its greenhouse gas emissions data and for not setting out any targets to reduce emissions in june 2012 apple inc withdrew its products from the electronic product environmental assessment tool electronic product environmental assessment tool epeat certification system but reversed this decision in july labor practices in 2006 the mail on sunday reported on the working conditions that existed at factories in china where the contract manufacturers foxconn and inventec produced the ipod the article stated that one complex of factories that assembles the ipod among other items had over 200 000 workers that lived and worked in the factory with employees regularly working more than 60 hours per week the article also reported that workers made around 100 per month and were required to live pay for rent and food from the company which generally amounted to a little over half of workers earnings apple immediately launched an investigation and worked with their manufacturers to ensure acceptable working conditions in 2007 apple started yearly audits of all its suppliers regarding worker s rights slowly raising standards and pruning suppliers that did not comply yearly progress reports have been published since 2008 in 2010 workers in china planned to sue iphone contractors over poisoning by a cleaner used to clean lcd screens one worker claimed that he and his coworkers had not been informed

subsidiaries in low tax places such as the republic of ireland the netherlands luxembourg and the british virgin islands to cut the taxes it pays around the world according to the new york times in the 1980s apple was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in high tax countries in a manner that allowed the company to sell on behalf of low tax subsidiaries on other continents sidestepping income taxes in the late 1980s apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the double irish arrangement dutch sandwich double irish with a dutch sandwich which reduces taxes by routing profits through irish subsidiaries and the netherlands and then to the caribbean british conservative party member of parliament charlie elphicke published research on october 30 2012 which showed that some multinational companies including apple inc were making billions of pounds of profit in the uk but were paying an effective tax rate to the uk treasury of only 3 percent well below standard corporation tax he followed this research by calling on the chancellor of the exchequer george osborne to force these multinationals which also included google and coca cola to state the effective rate of tax they pay on their uk revenues elphicke also said that government contracts should be withheld from multinationals who do not pay their fair share of uk tax charitable
